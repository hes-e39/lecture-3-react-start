## Dev Setup

**Prerequisite: you have `node` installed on the command line and can run `node --version`**

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of this repository
2. Run: `npm install`
3. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=vscom_downloads)
4. Open VSCode. Install the recommended extensions that pop up in the bottom right. If you don't see this, then you can manually install the following two extensions: [BiomeJS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) and [TailwindCSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss).
5. You might need to restart VSCode in order for extensions to take in effect. Restart by running `CMD+Shift+P` and search for "Reload Window", hit `Enter`.
6. Verify that BiomeJS is working by adding some extra indents/spaces in `src/main.tsx`. It should format the file on save.
7. Start the dev server with `npm run dev` and navigate to http://localhost:5173/

## Deploy to GH-Pages

**It is important that you follow these steps in the correct order:**

1. Open `package.json` and update the `"homepage"` key with your repo information. It should change from:

`"homepage": "https://hes-e39.github.io/react-ts-template/"`

to

`"homepage": "https://hes-e39.github.io/<your repo>/"`

For this assignment, the repo name will be `test-deploy-<your username>`.

Make sure the trailing `/` is there!

2. Push changes to GH
3. Wait until actions finish, this will create a new branch `gh-pages` and run the deployment
4. In your GH repo: Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment -> Branch -> gh-pages

You might have to hard refresh the browser page when pushing multiple updates to GH in order to reflect the most recent changes.
